# Memo Scripts

Sunbeam memo extension and golang script to add, read and edit memo entries via the command line.

## Features
* add memo entries from clipboard
* add memo entries from the command line
* The cmd filtered entries will only copy the value in the code block.  So it can be copied to the clipboard and pasted into a terminal

## Pre-requisites

1. Memo server https://www.usememos.com
2. Sunbeam https://sunbeam.pomdtr.me
3. Golang https://go.dev

## Installation

1. Install the script using go get:
   ```bash
   go get github.com/smetroid/memo-scripts
   ```
2. Add function to your shell configuration file (e.g., ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc):
   ```bash
   function prev() {
     ~/projects/memo-scripts/memo-scripts -shellCommand
   }
   ```
3. Install sunbeam extension
```bash
    make sunbeam-install
```

3.1 Configure the sunbeam extension by adding the following to your sunbeam config file:
```yaml
extensions:
  memo:
    url: https://your-memo-server.com
    token: your-memo-token
```
or enter the memo url and token when prompted

## Usage

### CLI

1. To save a cli command to memo:
```bash
  prev
```
2. Enter additional tags to go with the command
eg:
```bash
$î‚° prev
content: ./memo-scripts -help
Enter additional tags (comma-separated):
```
3. enter to save entry to memo server

### Clipboard

#### Pre-requisites

You must have Sumbeam terminal integration, alacritty or hyper

#### Usage

1. start hyper or alacritty via the shortcut/hotkey
2. You should see an option to create a memo entry from Clipboard

### Raycast

*Note:* sunbeam does provide a raycast extension, but was not able to get it working so this is a workaround

#### Pre-requisites

1. alacritty

#### Usage

1. Setup a raycast shortcut to run the raycast-alacritty.sh script

### Todo

- [ ] Implement delete memo functionality
- [ ] Binary downloads for the scripts
- [ ] Need to remove the #cmd tag from a memo entry if it's created via clipboard
- [ ] alacritty json config file
- [ ] Go routine to get all memo entries, and see if it improves performance
